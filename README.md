# DogeNotifier
A program that shows you the price of Dogecoin (in GBP) on your taskbar. Doge to the moon!

This will show you how many GBP Dogecoin is worth (the main app icon will be shown in pennies).

# Functionality
- Hovering over the tray icon will show you the entire full price.
- Sends you a toast notification every 30 seconds whenever the price falls to £0.33 or below
- Color coded to help you see when is a good time to buy/sell (green = above £0.40, yellow = above £0.34, red = £0.33 (time to buy more Doge!))
- Automatically updates the price every 5 seconds

Note: this program is not the most efficient or the cleanest/best practise code! Don't use this as a learning resource!
It is *not* future-proofed either, once Doge reached £1 and beyond, this program may not work as intended, this was simply something I threw together for me and a friend to monitor Doge.
When Doge reaches £1+, I will update this program to support higher number values and such.


Doge to the moon!
